<p>I never thought I would write a letter to published research to express deep concerns; this is certainly not something I want to do. Yet, there is no option but to write this post because otherwise, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00454-1">the recent paper by Carraro and Altermatt</a> (2022) invalidates my research (any research of scale invariance) for unfair reasons. I posted full details as a preprint here (including the re-analysis of their data).</p>
<p>As a stream ecologist, I’m interested in how a stream network structure dictates ecological dynamics - so the assessment of stream network structure is a critical component in my research. I use “branching probability” to measure network complexity, i.e., the probability of observing a single joining tributary per unit river distance. In my past studies (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1800060115">Terui et al. 2018</a>, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2105574118">2021</a>), I referred to <em>branching probability</em> as a variable reflecting the “scale invariance” of fractal rivers. In contrast, Carraro and Altermatt 2022 concluded in their paper, “<strong><em>...we show that an alleged property of such random networks (branching probability) is a scale-dependent quantity that does not reflect any recognized metric of rivers’ fractal character…</em></strong>” I was shocked because if this is true, what I had been saying in my papers was very wrong. However, after careful reading, this conclusion turned out to be due to the author’s misuse of the term “scale invariance.” The conclusion derived from their analysis must have been the complete opposite, “<strong><em>branching probability is a scale-invariant feature that reflects the fractal nature of rivers,</em></strong>” as explained below.</p>

<h2>Premise</h2>
<p><strong>Scale-invariance</strong> refers to a phenomenon in which a self-similar structure appears (almost) infinitely as you increase the resolution of the measurement. The most famous example of scale invariance is the length of the UK coastline. <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.156.3775.636">Mandelbrot 1967</a> used a ruler length <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> as a scale of observation (= the resolution of the measurement; see red-line segments in the image below) to measure the length of coastline <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and expressed it as a function of scale <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
y = f(x)
\]</span></p>

</div>
<p>When Mandelbrot measured the length of the coastline as multiples of the ruler length <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(N(x)x\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(N(x)\)</span> is the number of rulers needed given the length <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>), the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> diverged to reach infinity as <span class="math inline">\(x \rightarrow 0\)</span>, because he found finer, but similar zig-zag patterns over and over as he uses a shorter ruler (see the figure below; this is just for a graphical example). This observation is realized as a power-law scaling of length <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
y = f(x) = cx^{-z}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is the scaling constant and <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> the scaling exponent.</p>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="768" /></p>
<p>In this equation, the observed variable <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> reaches infinity as <span class="math inline">\(x \rightarrow 0\)</span>, reflecting the fractal nature of the coastline. In a power law, the shrinkage/extension of scale <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> will result in a simple multiplication of the observation <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. For example:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
y&#39;=f(2x)=c(2x)^{-z} = 2^{-z}cx^{-z} = 2^{-z}f(x) = 2^{-z}y
\]</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(y&#39;\)</span> is a simple multiplication of the original object <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is the part of <span class="math inline">\(y&#39;\)</span>), this proves that the structural property is retained across observation scale <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Therefore, <strong>the</strong> <strong>observed object</strong> <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> <strong>expressed as a function of scale</strong> <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> equals <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>) <strong>is said to be scale invariant when it follows a power-law</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><strong>.</strong> “Scaling” and “the lack of characteristic scale” are the properties associated with scale-invariance.</p>

<p>These terms are clearly explained in the textbook by Rodriquez-Iturbe &amp; Rinaldo 2001:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Self-similarity is a concept associated with fractal geometry that refers to invariance…The smaller structures are identical to the large-scale ones when they undergo an expansion in their scale. This similarity of parts to the whole is called self-similarity, and it is described by the lack of any characteristic scale, a property called scaling.</em> (p.99, Rodriquez-Iturbe &amp; Rinaldo 2001)</p>

<h2>What Carraro &amp; Altermatt found</h2>
<p>In Carraro &amp; Altermatt 2022, they reported that the branching probability follows a power law of observation scale <span class="math inline">\(A_T\)</span> using virtual networks called Optimal Channel Networks (Equation (1) in the original article). In addition, they also observed the power-law scaling of branching probability in real rivers (see the log-log plot in Figure 3 in the original article).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, they concluded “<strong><em>an alleged property of such random networks (branching probability) is a scale-dependent quantity that does not reflect any recognized metric of rivers’ fractal character…</em></strong>” This is the complete opposite as it has been defined in the literature of scale invariance (and “alleged”…!!!? This is simply a misuse of the term made by the authors!). Instead, the correct conclusion should be “<strong><em>branching probability is a scale-invariant feature that reflects the fractal nature of rivers.</em></strong>”</p>
<p>They also used other key terms in a completely opposite way – for example, the term “scaling” is used as if it describes a property of a scale-dependent object. If the use of these key terms is approved, it invalidates the entire body of literature in scale invariance since the 1960s because what we have been calling “scale-invariant” becomes “scale-dependent”…!</p>

<h2>Practical problem</h2>
<p>The fundamental problem in Carraro &amp; Altermatt (the misunderstanding of what we call scale invariant…) is actually very common – honestly, I fell into the same pitfall when I started studying scale invariance. Hence, I am very worried about the potential educational consequences of this paper – this paper has been published in one of the prestigious journals. This misuse is analogous to swapping the terms “competition” and “mutualism.” Thus, this problem is very deep…however, many of the potential readers (ecologists) seem unfamiliar with the definition of scale invariance and it will be super easy to get tricked. I wish this misuse will not facilitate the misunderstanding of the term scale invariance, which is mathematically and uniquely defined.</p>
